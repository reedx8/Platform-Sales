# Platform-Sales
If you need to revert back to this code in the "Platform Sales" spreadsheet, you must alter the spreadsheet in the following way:
1. Remove pop cooler category from TotalSalesByPlatform and TotalSalesByStore
2. Move popcooler items back to the Drinks category in MasterList tab/Menu Prices spreadsheet.
